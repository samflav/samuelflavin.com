                <p>
                    I'm a results-driven IT professional with a strong background in enterprise systems, software development, and automation. Currently serving in the United States Air Force, I bring a disciplined and analytical approach to solving complex technical challenges. This includes optimizing SAP processes, enhancing user experience through frontend design, and deploying scalable infrastructure on AWS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience spans full-stack development, database optimization, and scripting for workflow automation. I’ve built and maintained mission-critical systems, refined user interfaces for accessibility and responsiveness, and driven performance improvements across multiple platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I’m constantly exploring new technologies, refining my skills, and contributing to personal projects. These range from developing modular websites to streamlining backend processes. Whether in uniform or in code, my goal is to make systems more efficient, intuitive, and impactful.
